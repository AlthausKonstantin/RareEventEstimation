Solving the Diffusion Problem (d=150) with the CBREE (vMFNM, resampled) method using  different parameters. We vary the averaging method (color), the stepsize tolerance $\epsilon_{\text{Target}}$ (column) and the divergence criterion $N_\text{obs}$ (row). The choice of the stopping criterion $\Delta_{\text{Target}} = 2$ and indicator approximation $I_\text{alg}$ are fixed. Furthermore we plot also the performance of the benchmark methods EnKF(with different importance sampling densities)and SiS (with different MCMC sampling methods). We used the sample sizes $J \in \{1000, 2000, \ldots, 6000\}$. Each marker represents the empirical estimates based the successful portion of $200$ simulations.
