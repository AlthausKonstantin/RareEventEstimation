Comparing the emprirical average cost of the CBREE (GM) method for different values of $N_{ \text{obs} } > 1$  and $\Delta_{\text{Target}}=1$ to the base case of ommiting the divergence check. The parameter $\epsilon_{\text{Target}} = 0.5$ and the choice of the indicator approximation $I_\text{alg}$ are fixed. For each problem and choice of $N_{ \text{obs} } > 1$ as well as for the base case we average the empirical average cost over all sample sizes $J$ before computing the proportion to the base case.
