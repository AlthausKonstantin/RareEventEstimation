Comparing the success rates of the CBREE  method for different values of $N_{ \text{obs} }$  averaged over all sample sizes $J =   \{1000, 2000, \ldots, 6000\}$. The parameters $\Delta_{\text{Target}}=1$, $\epsilon_{\text{Target}} = 0.5$ and the choice of the indicator approximation $I_\text{alg}$ are fixed. The values denote the relative number of cases the CBREE method converged successfully for the particular combination of problem and paramter setting (in total 1200 per setting).
