The effect of the divergence check on the Fujita Rackwitz Problem (d=2). We show the empirical error and cost estimates based on all 200 simulations (successful or not) if the CBREE methods runs with no divergence check. The same quantities  based on the successful portion of the 200 simulations are plotted for different values of $N_\text{obs}$ if the divergence check is active.The parameters $\Delta_{\text{Target}}=1$,  $\epsilon_{\text{Target}} = 0.5$ and the choice of the indicator approximation $I_\text{alg}$ are fixed.
