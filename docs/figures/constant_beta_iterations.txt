Solving Linear Problem (d=50) with the CBREE method using  $J = 5000$ particles, stopping criterion $\Delta_{\text{Target}} = 4$, stepsize tolerance $\epsilon_{\text{Target}} = 1$, controlling the increase of $\sigma$ with $\text{Lip}(\sigma) = 1$ and approximating the indicator function with $I_\text{alg}$. No divergence check has been performed and the solver was able to run for at most 100 iterations. The vertical lines mark iterations whose weights we investigate.
