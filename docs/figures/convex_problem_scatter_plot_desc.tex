Contour plot of the Convex Problem.Also the final ensemble of the CBREE, SiS and EnKF methods respectively is plotted. Each method used $J=1000$ samples and the stopping criterion $\Delta_{\text{Target}}$ = 1.5. The CBREE method performed no divergence check, used the approximation $I_\text{alg}$, the stepsize control $\epsilon{\text{Target}}=0.5$ and controled the increase of $\sigma$ with $\text{Lip}(\sigma) = 1$
