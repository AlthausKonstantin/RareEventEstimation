Solving the Convex Problem with the CBREE method using  $J \in \{250, 500, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000\}$ particles, stopping criterion $\Delta_{\text{Target}} = 2$, stepsize tolerance $\epsilon_{\text{Target}} = 0.5$, controlling the increase of $\sigma$ with $\text{Lip}(\sigma) = 1$ and approximating the indicator function with $I_\text{alg}$. No divergence check has been performed. Each simulation was repeated 200 times. While the markers present the empirical means of the visualized data, the error bars are drawn from first to the third quartile.
